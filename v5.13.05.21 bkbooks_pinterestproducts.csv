  What are the signs of dying? Death from disease doesn't just occur; there is a process. People die in stages of months, weeks, days, and hours. Having this knowledge will help address the fear of death and dying that most of us bring to the bedside of a person who is dying.

ATIMETOLIVE-ENGLISH,A Time to Live: Living with A Life-Threatening Illness," 
 For the newly diagnosed facing a life limiting illness. This booklet addresses issues of comfort, nutrition, and sleep as they relate to the palliative care patient. It provides guidance to help them live the best life they can within the confines of their body and disease.      
  When a person receives the diagnosis of a life-threatening illness, life as they know it ceases. They find themselves in uncharted territory with no script to follow. Too often they withdraw from the world, as if they have already died. All activity becomes centered on their living with disease and its treatment. Fear and uncertainty replaces confidence and self identity. The joys of living are more or less put on hold while living as long as possible is pursued.    
   A Time to Live  honors whatever life prolonging choices are being made while at the same time suggesting we look at the gifts life offers each day.     
   
   “Living"" -  what does that word really mean? Everyone has a different answer. Start with the idea that you are alive right now. If you are reading this booklet and have  a life threatening illness then you will be alive next week and probably next month. So, what do you want to do or say? What is keeping you from doing or saying it? How can those obstacles be overcome?   - Barbara Karnes, A  Time To Live

We do not know that all of these feelings together represent grief; a normal, natural response to the loss of someone or something.   No one has taught us what it feels like to grieve. We don’t know how to heal the hurt created by grief or how to live with it.   My Friend, I Care  offers simple explanations for the thoughts and feelings generated by grief.
